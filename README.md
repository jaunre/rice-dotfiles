# rice-dotfiles
Note that the bspwmrc file is set up in such a way that it accounts for multiple of my polybar setups. You can change this if you wish.
Make sure you store the polybar config files in an extra directory i.e.

.config/polybar/material/...

That is, make sure all the dotfiles for polybar are contained within the "material" directory *if you use my bspwmrc setup.
